# Directed Topology

## Description
This git repository is created with the goal of obtaining formal proofs in the field of Directed Topology written in the *Lean theorem prover* language.
In particular, our aim is the Van Kampen Theorem concerning Fundamental Categories.

This is the port to Lean 4. A version using Lean 3 already exists in a different [repository](https://github.com/Dominique-Lawson/Directed-Topology/tree/main).

## Installation
Installing Lean can be done by following the [leanprover community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).
Our project uses Lean version 4.6.0.

This repository can then be cloned by following the instructions on [this page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html).
